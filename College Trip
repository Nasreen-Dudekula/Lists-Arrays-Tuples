College Trip
 
North Karnataka students planned a class trip to South Karnataka places. Students were very excited about the trip. They made a list of place that they wanted to visit. After a big discussion between the students, they shortlisted 3 best places: Madekeri, Mysore and Mangalore. Now Class leader Ram is confused about the location of the trip.
 

So he decided to conduct voting to select the place. Students agreed with this option.
Students who want to go Madikeri should vote 1, for Mysore vote 2 and for Mangalore they should vote 3.
The place which got highest votes will be the trip location. He also warned them that, if more than one place got same highest number of votes then the trip will be cancelled.
Help Ram to decide the place by wiriting a program.
