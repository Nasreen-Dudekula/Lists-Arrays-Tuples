CODE:



n=int(input())

l=[]

m=[]

for i in range(n):

    a=int(input())

    l.append(a)

s=int(input())

for i in range(n):

    b=l[i]%5

    if b==0:

        c=l[i]+5

    elif b==1:

        c=l[i]+4

    elif b==2:

        c=l[i]+3

    elif b==3:

        c=l[i]+2

    elif b==4:

        c=l[i]+1

    m.append(c)

r=sum(m)

e=r*s
