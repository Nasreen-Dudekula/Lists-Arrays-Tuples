Encrypted Array

Ramesh and Suresh working in a security agency, they receive secret Encrypted data from their officers. Every time they will hard to decode the Encrypted data, So Ramesh decided to write a program to decode the Encrypted data. The encrypted array is obtained by subtracting  ‘x’ with the exncrypted array elements , where ‘x’ is obtained by dividing the (sum of encrypted array) with ((length of encrypted array) – 1).

                                                                                          Image result for encrypted data
 

So can u help Ramesh to write a program to find the encrypted array?

 Input Format Specifications:

    The first line of input consists of the size of an Encrypted Array Integer.
    The next line of input contains inputs to the Encrypted Array Integer.

 Output Format Specifications:

    The first line of output contains the Encrypted Array.
    The second line of output contains the original Array.
    The format will be shown below in the sample output.

  Sample Input 1:
  5
 12
  7
  8
  9
 10
 Sample Output 1:
 [12, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 -1 4 3 2 1
 
 
 
 CODE:
 
 
 
 
 n=int(input())

l=[]

for i in range(n):

    a=int(input())

    l.append(a)

s=sum(l)//(n-1)

print(l)

for i in range(n):

    r=s-l[i]

    print(r,end=" ")
